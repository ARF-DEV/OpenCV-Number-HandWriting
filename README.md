# OpenCV Number Handwriting

Handwritten digit recognition using OpenCV + TensorFlow (Deep Learning)

## 📋 Overview

This project implements handwritten-digit recognition using a Deep Learning model built with TensorFlow. OpenCV is used only for image preprocessing (grayscale, thresholding, contour extraction), while the actual classification is performed by a trained neural network.

The repository contains:
- Model/ — TensorFlow/Keras model and its saved artifacts
- My Handwriting *.jpeg — real handwritten samples for testing
- Notebook/script for preprocessing, prediction, and visualization
